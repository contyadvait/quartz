## What can forces do to an object?

Forces can

- Change the shape,
- Change the size,
- Change the state of rest or motion,
- Bring about turning effect on objects,
- and exert pressure on objects

# Weight and Mass

## Forces

- Forces are a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">push</mark> or <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pull</mark>
- There are many different kind of forces
- Here is a free body diagram of a skydiver<br>![[IMG_0990.jpeg]]

## Weight Vs Mass

| Component | Definition                                 | SI Unit        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Mass      | The amount of matter an object can contain | kg (Kilograms) |
| Weight    | The amount of force being exerted          | N (Newtons)    |

### Calculating Weight

- The formula is $\text{Weight} = \text{Mass } \times \text{Gravitational Strength}$
- The mass should be in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Kg</mark> (SI Units)
- Normal gravitational strength on earth is about 10 N/kg

---

## Pressure

- The pressure is the amount of force being implemented on the ground
- Normally more accurate indication of material strength then weight
- The formula for Pressure is $$\text{Pressure} = \frac{\text{Force (N)}}{\text{Surface area}}$$
- For example, let's compare an elephant with a women wearing high heels
  - a women on heels can exert 2,400,000 Pa (Pascals) of combined force on the ground
  - The elephant will only exert 150,000 Pa as the elephant
  - This is because the women has a much lower surface area then the elephant

## Turning Force

- Turning Force is the about of force required to move something by its hinge (also known as a fulcrum)
- For example, a wrench being turned further away from the pivot will require much less force then being turned closer to the pivot<br>

# Formulas and Units

### Units

| Item     | Unit | Full Form |
| -------- | ---- | --------- |
| Pressure | Pa   | Pascals   |
| Weight   | N    | Newton    |
| Mass     | Kg   | Kilograms |

### Formulas

$$\text{Pressure} = \frac{\text{Force}}{\text{Surface Area}}$$
$$\text{Weight} = \text{Mass } \times \text{ Gravitational Force}$$
