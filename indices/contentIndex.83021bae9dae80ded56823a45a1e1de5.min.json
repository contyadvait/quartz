All went lame; all blind;  \nDrunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots  \nOf gas-shells dropping softly behind.\n\n---\n\n### Stanza 2\n\n---\n\nGas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling  \nFitting the clumsy helmets just in time,  \nBut someone still was yelling out and stumbling  \nAnd flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.—  \nDim through the misty panes and thick green light,  \nAs under a green sea, I saw him drowning.\n\n---\n\n### Stanza 3\n\n---\n\nIn all my dreams before my helpless sight,  \nHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.\n\n---\n\n### Stanza 4\n\n---\n\nIf in some smothering dreams, you too could pace  \nBehind the wagon that we flung him in,  \nAnd watch the white eyes writhing in his face,  \nHis hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin;  \nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood  \nCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,  \nObscene as cancer, bitter as the cud  \nOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—  \nMy friend, you would not tell with such high zest  \nTo children ardent for some desperate glory,  \nThe old Lie: *Dulce et decorum est\nPro patria mori.*\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-05T14:41:34.870185075Z","tags":[]},"/Forces":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"---\nsticker: emoji//1f606\ntags: science, endofyear, ga3, s2\nbanner: https://www.ussportscamps.com/media/images/soccer/nike/tips/Freekick-Tip-Pic.jpg\ntitle: \"Forces\"\ntags:\n- ga3\n- endofyear\n- science\n- physics\n---\n\n## What can forces do to an object?\n\nForces can\n\n- Change the shape,\n- Change the size,\n- Change the state of rest or motion,\n- Bring about turning effect on objects,\n- and exert pressure on objects\n\n---\n\n# Weight and Mass\n\n## Forces\n\n- Forces are a \u003cmark style=\"background: #FFF3A3A6;\"\u003epush\u003c/mark\u003e or \u003cmark style=\"background: #FFF3A3A6;\"\u003epull\u003c/mark\u003e\n- There are many different kind of forces\n- Here is a free body diagram of a skydiver\u003cbr\u003e![[IMG_0990.jpeg]]\n\n---\n\n## Weight Vs Mass\n\n| Component | Definition                                 | SI Unit        |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------- |\n| Mass      | The amount of matter an object can contain | kg (Kilograms) |\n| Weight    | The amount of force being exerted          | N (Newtons)    |\n\n---\n\n### Calculating Weight\n\n- The formula is $\\text{Weight} = \\text{Mass } \\times \\text{Gravitational Strength}$\n- The mass should be in \u003cmark style=\"background: #FFF3A3A6;\"\u003eKg\u003c/mark\u003e (SI Units)\n- Normal gravitational strength on earth is about 10 N/kg\n\n---\n\n## Pressure\n\n- The pressure is the amount of force being implemented on the ground\n- Normally more accurate indication of material strength then weight\n- The formula for Pressure is $$\\text{Pressure} = \\frac{\\text{Force (N)}}{\\text{Surface area}}$$\n- For example, let's compare an elephant with a women wearing high heels\n  - a women on heels can exert 2,400,000 Pa (Pascals) of combined force on the ground\n  - The elephant will only exert 150,000 Pa as the elephant\n  - This is because the women has a much lower surface area then the elephant\n\n---\n\n## Turning Force\n\n- Turning Force is the about of force required to move something by its hinge (also known as a fulcrum)\n- For example, a wrench being turned further away from the pivot will require much less force then being turned closer to the pivot\u003cbr\u003e\n  ![[spanner3.gif]]\n  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n---\n\n# Formulas and Units\n\n### Units\n\n| Item     | Unit | Full Form |\n| -------- | ---- | --------- |\n| Pressure | Pa   | Pascals   |\n| Weight   | N    | Newton    |\n| Mass     | Kg   | Kilograms |\n\n### Formulas\n\n$$\\text{Pressure} = \\frac{\\text{Force}}{\\text{Surface Area}}$$\n$$\\text{Weight} = \\text{Mass } \\times \\text{ Gravitational Force}$$\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-05T14:41:34.870185075Z","tags":[]},"/Sustainable-Transportation":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"---\nbanner: https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--aqYTMv6j--/c_fill,g_auto,h_468,w_830/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2021-08/whatsapp-image-2021-08-25-at-11.50.11.jpeg?itok=YAoZIYJ9\ntags: geography, endofyear, s2, ga3\n---\n# Sustainable Transport ","lastmodified":"2023-08-05T14:41:34.878185089Z","tags":[]}}
